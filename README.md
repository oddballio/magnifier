# Magnifier  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/oddballio/magnifier.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/oddballio/magnifier)

A spike for a tool to reveal the individual and team contributions that employees have made to its projects.

## Native Installation 

At its core, Magnifier is comprised of a Rails backend, and a React frontend.  Here are the associated dependencies you'll need:

- [Required Ruby version](https://github.com/oddballio/magnifier/blob/master/.ruby-version)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started)

Once you've ensured that you have all of the above installed, here are the steps to getting the app up and running locally:

#### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the repo and `cd` into the `magnifier` directory

#### 2. Get the Master Key

You will need our **master key** to run the app. See the [Master Key](#master-key) section for more details.

#### 3. Install JS dependencies

```
$ yarn install
```

#### 4. Setup Rails

```
$ bin/setup
```

#### 5. Start the Rails server

```
$ rails s
```

#### 6. Open the app

Visit http://localhost:3000/

### Master Key

**You will need our master key** to work with the application.  More details can be found on our [Encrypted Credentials wiki page](https://github.com/oddballio/magnifier/wiki/Encrypted-Credentials). 

Here's how to get your master key setup:

1. To maintain security around this key, it will be shared via the [Keybase app](https://keybase.io/)
2. Ping our Slack `#oddball-tools` room, and request for someone to send you the key via Keybase
3. Create a file `config/master.key` file in your local Magnifier repo (this file is already part of our [`.gitignore` file](https://github.com/oddballio/magnifier/blob/master/.gitignore))
4. Add the `master` key to the file


Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies, copy git hooks and bootstrap local development db.

## Front end

React-rails is configured, without react router currently

All components are visible in `app/javascript/components`

I've followed the paradigm introduced by Dan Abramov back in 2015 around smart and dumb components. Further reading on this topic is available [here](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)

* To generate a react component *

`rails g react:component $COMPONENT_NAME`

Currently there is no connection from React to Rails, in a seperate PR, once the graphql stuff is implemented we can connect the apollo-provider to our graphql endpoint.

Currently using regular old css, but I brought in [Tail Wind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) to make things a little easier

### Routing

All routes are listed in `app/javascript/routes.js`. We are currently use `react-router@v4` be aware the API has changed significantly since 3.0, reading their quick start guide ([available_here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)) will be immensely helpful.

There is a great example on how to do client side auth routing that we should bring in: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/auth-workflow

## JS Linting

Prettier is currently configured with eslint, please google "Eslint format on save + your specific text editor" in order to take advantage of this

There are currently two scripts that can be ran

* `npm run eslint:fix` automatically reformats all js files
* `npm run eslint` - for use on CI, lints all files and shows results

## Test Suite

Magnifier uses RSpec for its backend test suite.  

#### Run the specs

```
$ rspec
```

#### Run specs with Guard

Magnifier uses the [Guard::RSpec gem](https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec) to automatically run your specs.  To use it run:

```
$ bundle exec guard
```
